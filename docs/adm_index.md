# Welcome to the MCDI JIRA Administration Section

Within this section, you will find information relating to various administrative tools within JIRA.  If you are not an administrative user, many of these functions will not be available to you, or will only work in a limited capacity.  

As many of these functions have the potential to cause problems for other users if misused, it is important for all administrators to acquaint themselves with the contents of this section.

All requests for special access to specific administrative functions outlined here must be logged as "Feature Access Request" issues under the [!ITHD](ec2-54-162-47-42.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/projects/ITHD/issues) project and approved by a direct supervisor and systems administrator.
