##JIRA Query Language (JQL) Filtering

Should you require additional filtering over and above the simple column filters provided in the UI, you can access the JQL interface by clicking the "Advanced" link.  This interface accepts query statements written in JQL, which allows you to create powerful cross-sections of data with relative ease.  [For more information on JQL syntax, please refer to this cheat sheet.](https://gist.github.com/emmajane/59321345a81a4f5837c0)

##Saving a Filter

When you have created the filter you want, click the "Save as" button in the top left corner of the interface, enter a name for the filter in the "Filter Name" box, and click the "Submit" button.

Once the filter has been saved, you can access it from the "View all issues and filters" screen.  Your most used filters will appear in the "Favorite Filters" section of the left-hand sidebar.
