##Description

Smart Attachments is a real catch when you work with multiple attachments in each JIRA issue. Now you can easily manage them, as follows:

* Create categories per issue types and further distribute attachments among categories
* Drag and drop files to or among attachment categories
* Use revisions for keeping distinct file versions within one document
* Edit your documents, workbooks, presentations and drawings in MS Office
* Send attachments to emails of your colleagues and partners from JIRA
* Search for issues with attachments by name, format, document name or uploader
* Customize attachment management experience with validators, conditions and post-functions
* Comment the already loaded files and revisions
* Restrict access to certain categories for users, groups or roles
* Perform bulk actions (group removal, archive download, category migration or archivation to category)
* Import configuration from other JIRA projects
