##Description

Think you know JIRA exporting limits? Think again.

In JIRA, there is only a single pre-determined export document style that also looks rather unattractive and is very hard to edit. BigTemplate lets you upload and assign different document styles to make JIRA issues easily adaptable into different internal needs of an end-user company Users can define their own document templates and assign them to tasks in different projects.


With BigTemplate you can set up simplified asset management process, Simply create new JIRA project to search, aggregate and manage your inventory, while still having the ability to print beautiful documents as a physical copy with a single click.

Why not make employees ask for and receive holidays as JIRA tasks, and then just print the official leave paperwork immediately and be done with it? No more circulating empty documents via e-mail, with multiple versions, lost formatting and missed deadlines.

Well, no more imagining. Time to do this!
