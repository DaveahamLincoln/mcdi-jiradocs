The purpose of this article is to provide access detailed information about the types of issues in MCDI's JIRA Core projects, and their proper usage.

##Hierarchy

Issues in JIRA are organized into a parent-child hierarchy under a given JIRA Core project, as illustrated below.

##Epics

An epic captures a large body of work. It is essentially a large undertaking (similar to a SharePoint "Component") that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories (similar to SharePoint "Activities").

The average user **should not** have a business need to create an Epic, unless directed to do so by a superior.  When in doubt, please refer to the [Issue Type Decision Tree](#issue-type-decision-tree).
