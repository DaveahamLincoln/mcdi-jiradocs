##Transition of MCDI IT Case Handling to JIRA

From: Eric Dimbleby

Subject: MCDI IT Help Desk Request Protocol

Date: 12/1/2016

Recipients: All MCDI Staff, Both Field and Home Office

Good Afternoon,

In an effort to better track our day to day help desk requests in the MCDI division (and eventually in the other
divisions as well), we are asking that all MCDI helpdesk requests be submitted through JIRA. Given the various
projects Dave is currently working on through the end of the year and into 2017, a more concerted effort to share,
track, and triage responses from I.T. is underway. Matt McSpadden, based out of our Augusta office, has graciously
offered his monitoring and assistance for this range of issues, in a hope that we can allow Dave more time to
focus on the JIRA roll-out and a list of other important projects he is ramping up. For anything that requires
onsite work, Matt will work with Dave directly.

Field Office Personnel
We would also request that all field office personnel have their Home Office contact create new requests.
How To Log Your Issue
To create a new issue for IT Support, please click the CREATE button at the top of the screen in JIRA, and report
