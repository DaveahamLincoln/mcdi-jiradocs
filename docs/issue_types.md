The purpose of this guide is to provide access to detailed information about the types of issues in MCDI's JIRA installation, and their proper usage.

##Atlassian Documentation

MCDI's JIRA installation has been designed from the ground up to mirror the best-practice concepts for structural organization as outlined by Atlassian, in an effort to ensure that their system documentation is maximally compatible with our own.  In light of that fact, an effort has been made to include links to relevant articles within the Atlassian knowledge-base for further reading where possible.

##General Notes

MCDI's JIRA instance is currently configured to serve two different types of projects:

* **JIRA Core** projects, which the majority of users will utilize for day-to-day work.
* **JIRA Software** projects, which will be utilized primarily by IT for managing development activities.

```Ruby
Note: A third type of project, the JIRA Helpdesk project, is supported for first-line IT and Customer Service
functions, but not implemented at this time.
```

Depending upon the project type, the available issue types and their use cases will change.  Please refer to the appropriate section for your use case.
