##Description

Structure add-on for JIRA is a project and portfolio management tool for everyone from small teams to large enterprises.

Whether you're Agile, Scaled Agile, Waterfall, or something in between, you can create anything from personal backlogs to big-picture overviews of the entire company portfolio.

Structure lets you organize issues into hierarchies of any depth, so you can plan your projects in as much detail as you need.

Tight integration with Agile means you can create overviews of entire Agile projects, multiple boards, sprints, release backlogs and more.

Progress, time and other values are aggregated up through the hierarchy so you can clearly see what's going on at any level.

Structure allows you to visualize complex relationships between linked issues, adding an extra dimension of clarity to large project planning.
