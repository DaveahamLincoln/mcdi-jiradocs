In light of that fact, an effort has been made to include links to relevant articles within the Atlassian knowledge-base for further reading where possible.\n\n\nYou can view an overview of JIRA Core's structure here.\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nCategories are collections of projects which share a common attribute.   As an example, the category\n\n\n\"MCDI Operations\"\n contains the following projects:\n\n\n\n\nand the category \n\"MCDI Projects\"\n contains the following projects:\n\n\n\n\nGiving projects a parent category designation allows for more precise sectioning of structure, allowing for the support of a diverse range of BUs within a single application.\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nProjects are roughly analogous to \"Departments\" or \"Business Functions\" within the application context.  Projects serve as \"buckets\" for issues (see below).  Each project has a long-form name, like\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Development\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nBenin ARM3\n\n\n\n\nand a short-form name (\"slug\") like\n\n\n\n\nBD\n\n\nFIN\n\n\nBARM3\n\n\n\n\nThe long-form name is utilized primarily for navigation within the UI, whereas the slug is used primarily for referencing issues.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nThe most basic \"work packet\" in JIRA is the Issue.  There are multiple types of issues, which all serve different functions.  For more detail about working with issues, please peruse the \nWorking With Issues\n page.\n\n\nWhen an issue is created, it is assigned a unique identifier comprised of the slug of the parent project and the index of the issue within the project context, i.e.\n\n\n\n\nHR-1\n\n\nBARM3-14\n\n\nZICORE-9\n\n\n\n\n    Power Tip: simply typing the identifier of an issue within a comment or description field will generate\n    an interactive link to that issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nIn contrast to SharePoint, \"Component\" is a predefined keyword within JIRA that is utilized for the subdivision of issues within a project.  \"Epics\" (discussed below) take the place of SharePoint components.  \n\n\nThe component attribute is most useful in projects that interact with many other projects, such as Finance and HR, but also has a place in smaller projects as a tool for indicating \"categories of work\" (i.e. Work Planning/Management/etc.).   By way of example, take a look at the currently configured components within the HR project:\n\n\n\n\nThis change makes it unnecessary to create \"subsites\" for things like Finance and HR within each project, opting instead for a clearinghouse paradigm where data is organized in a top-down fashion, rather than from the bottom-up.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let's say that you want to create a task in the (FIN) project for the procurement of widgets for the ZICORE project.  In order to do this, you would create a story or subtask under the Finance project (see \nIssue Types\n for more information on creating issues), and assign it to the ZICORE component, as shown here:\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the majority of clearinghouse-style projects (especially Finance and HR), you would also need to select an Issue Security level before saving the issue.\n\n\n\n\nIssue Security (ISSEC) Levels\n\n\nJIRA introduces the concept of ISSEC levels to provide an additional dimension of security for \"eyes only\" data.  Not all projects utilize an ISSEC dimension, relying instead on project-level permissions for access control.  As a general rule, projects which operate according to the clearinghouse paradigm (FIN/HR/etc.) generally have an ISSEC dimension, whereas projects which are self-contained (ZICORE/BARM3/etc.) generally \ndo not\n have an ISSEC dimension.  \n\n\nThe vast majority of ISSEC dimensions follow the below pattern (where X is a project slug), arranged from highest security to lowest:\n\n\n\n\nX Restricted\n\n\nX\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nIf a project does have an ISSEC dimension, a field labeled \"Security Level\" will appear on the issue creation screen for that project.  \n\n\n\n\nFrom a user perspective, you will only be able to create issues with ISSEC levels for which you have clearance, so for the majority of users, the number of choices available within a given \"Security Level\" dialog will be fairly small.  \n\n\nIt is \nimportant\n to match the ISSEC clearance with the selected component.  The rule of thumb for this is to simply ensure that the slug you select in the \"Component\" field (i.e. ZICORE) matches the leading slug of the ISSEC level you select in the \"Security Level\" field.",

This screen can be broken down into a number of regions, which all serve different functions.  In this section, a detailed overview of the functions and vocabulary related to each region will be laid out for easy reference, moving from the top right to the bottom left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue Header\n\n\n\n\nThe Issue Header region shows three important pieces of information:\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the parent project (ZICORE)\n\n\nThe issue's ID (ZICORE-28)\n\n\nThe name of the issue (Work Planning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue Toolbar\n\n\n\n\nThe issue toolbar gives you easy access to some of the most important functions within an issue.\n\n\n\n\nClicking the \"Edit\" button will open a form where you can edit multiple fields at once before saving.\n\n\nClicking the \"Comment\" button will snap your view to the Comment region and open an editor for you so that you can leave a comment on the issue.\n\n\nClicking the \"Assign\" button opens a dialog which allows you to reassign an issue to another user and leave a comment about the assignment change.\n\n\nClicking the \"More\" button will open a menu with advanced functions not covered here...yet.\n\n\nThe next three buttons and their usage will change depending on the workflow configured for the issue type.  Please see \nDefault Workflow Usage\n for more information.\n\n\nThe \"Admin\" button will not be visible for the majority of users, but gives access to multiple power-user functions.\n\n\nThe square button with the arrow coming out of it is the \"Share\" button.  This button reveals a dialog which will assist you in creating an external link to the issue.\n\n\nClicking the \"Export\" button will reveal a set of options for saving the issue to your local machine in various formats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue Details\n\n\n\n\nThe Issue Details region allows you to quickly view the essential metadata of an issue.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Type\" field shows you what type of issue the issue is.  Please see \nthe issue type section for your project\n for more information.\n\n\nThe \"Priority\" field shows you the issue's current priority level.\n\n\nThe \"Component/s\" field not only shows the configured component/s for an issue, it provides hyperlinks to these components, which can be used for navigational purposes.\n\n\nThe \"Labels\" field shows all of the keywords which other users have tagged the issue with.  Labels allow users to add ad-hoc semantic search dimensions to issues for future reference.\n\n\nTo add a label, click the pencil next to the field, type in your desired label/s, and click the check mark.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Status\" field shows the icon for the workflow step that the issue is currently in.  \n\n\nClicking the \"View Workflow\" link will show you a flowchart for the workflow, in case you need a cheat sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Resolution\" field will be updated with a resolution message once the issue has been resolved.  Please see \nDefault Workflow Usage\n for more information regarding issue resolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\nThe People region gives you a window into the other users interacting with the issue alongside you.\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Assignee\" field shows you the current user assigned to the task.  \n\n\nThe Assignee role is explained in more detail on the \nDefault Workflow Usage\n, but essentially, the Assignee is the user who needs to take the next step in moving the issue along through the workflow.  \n\n\nIf you need to take over the Assignee role, you can click the \"Assign to me\" link in order to take ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Reporter\" field shows the name of the user that initially reported the issue.  This knowledge can be useful if you're looking to find a source for more information about a given issue.\n\n\nThe \"Vote\" field shows a tally of the number of users who have clicked the \"Vote for this issue\" link, indicating that they would like it to be given priority over other issues.  \n\n\nThere is no formal requirement that issues with a high number of votes be given priority, however, this can be a useful tool for making decisions about your time when faced with multiple open issues.  \n\n\nPlease vote sparingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Watchers\" field shows the number of people who are currently receiving email notifications for the issue.  \n\n\nAs a general rule, any time you interact with an issue in any way other than viewing it (i.e. changing a status, leaving a comment, etc.), you will be added to the Watchers list for that issue.  \n\n\nTo view a list of users watching the issue, simply click the number in the circle.  \n\n\nTo stop watching the issue, click the \"Stop watching this issue\" link.\n\n\nTo re-subscribe to the issue as a watcher, click the \"Start watching this issue\" link, which will replace the \"Stop watching this issue\" link when you are not subscribed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nThe Description region is a text field which is used to store an explanation of what the issue is for.  \n\n\n\n\nIt should include information which is relevant to assisting assigned users in moving the issue towards a resolution.\n\n\nEpics and Stories  may not always have descriptions, but Subtasks and Tasks should always have a description.  \n\n\nThe description can be edited by clicking on the Description region, or through the Edit menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dates region allows users to see the time and date when the issue was created, when it was last updated, and once closed, the date of closure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttachments\n\n\n\n\nThe Attachments region is used to view, manage, and organize documents attached to a given issue.  JIRA's core attachment functionality has been expanded through the use of a plugin called Smart Attachments.  \nThe extended documentation for the plugin is available here.\n\n\n\n\nTo upload a new document to a task, drag the file from a folder on your computer and hold it over the issue screen.  An overlay of boxes corresponding to the different categories available for the document will appear- simply release the file over the box that corresponds to the category you would like to upload the document to, and JIRA will handle the rest of the upload process.\n\n\nThe maximum allowed file size for each individual attachment is 57.22MB.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have uploaded attachments to an issue, the Attachments region will look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo move individual files between categories, simply click and drag.\n\n\nClicking on the hyperlinked filename will download a standalone copy of the file to your system.
