In light of that fact, an effort has been made to include links to relevant articles within the Atlassian knowledge-base for further reading where possible.\n\n\nYou can view an overview of JIRA Core's structure here.\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nCategories are collections of projects which share a common attribute.   As an example, the category\n\n\n\"MCDI Operations\"\n contains the following projects:\n\n\n\n\nand the category \n\"MCDI Projects\"\n contains the following projects:\n\n\n\n\nGiving projects a parent category designation allows for more precise sectioning of structure, allowing for the support of a diverse range of BUs within a single application.\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\nProjects are roughly analogous to \"Departments\" or \"Business Functions\" within the application context.  Projects serve as \"buckets\" for issues (see below).  Each project has a long-form name, like\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Development\n\n\nFinance\n\n\nBenin ARM3\n\n\n\n\nand a short-form name (\"slug\") like\n\n\n\n\nBD\n\n\nFIN\n\n\nBARM3\n\n\n\n\nThe long-form name is utilized primarily for navigation within the UI, whereas the slug is used primarily for referencing issues.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\n\nThe most basic \"work packet\" in JIRA is the issue.  There are multiple types of issues, which all serve different functions.  For more detail about issue types and their roles within JIRA, please peruse the \nIssue Types\n page.\n\n\nWhen an issue is created, it is assigned a unique identifier comprised of the slug of the parent project and the index of the issue within the project context, i.e.\n\n\n\n\nHR-1\n\n\nBARM3-14\n\n\nZICORE-9\n\n\n\n\n    Power Tip: simply typing the identifier of an issue within a comment or description field will generate\n    an interactive link to that issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nIn contrast to SharePoint, \"Component\" is a predefined keyword within JIRA that is utilized for the subdivision of issues within a project.  \"Epics\" (discussed below) take the place of SharePoint components.  \n\n\nThe component attribute is most useful in projects that interact with many other projects, such as Finance and HR, but also has a place in smaller projects as a tool for indicating \"categories of work\" (i.e. Work Planning/Management/etc.).   By way of example, take a look at the currently configured components within the HR project:\n\n\n\n\nThis change makes it unnecessary to create \"subsites\" for things like Finance and HR within each project, opting instead for a clearinghouse paradigm where data is organized in a top-down fashion, rather than from the bottom-up.\n\n\nTo illustrate, let's say that you want to create a task in the (FIN) project for the procurement of widgets for the ZICORE project.  In order to do this, you would create a story or subtask under the Finance project (see \nIssue Types\n for more information on creating issues), and assign it to the ZICORE component, as shown here:\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the majority of clearinghouse-style projects (especially Finance and HR), you would also need to select an Issue Security level before saving the issue.\n\n\n\n\nIssue Security (ISSEC) Levels\n\n\nJIRA introduces the concept of ISSEC levels to provide an additional dimension of security for \"eyes only\" data.  Not all projects utilize an ISSEC dimension, relying instead on project-level permissions for access control.  As a general rule, projects which operate according to the clearinghouse paradigm (FIN/HR/etc.) generally have an ISSEC dimension, whereas projects which are self-contained (ZICORE/BARM3/etc.) generally \ndo not\n have an ISSEC dimension.  \n\n\nThe vast majority of ISSEC dimensions follow the below pattern (where X is a project slug), arranged from highest security to lowest:\n\n\n\n\nX Restricted\n\n\nX\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nIf a project does have an ISSEC dimension, a field labeled \"Security Level\" will appear on the issue creation screen for that project.  \n\n\n\n\nFrom a user perspective, you will only be able to create issues with ISSEC levels for which you have clearance, so for the majority of users, the number of choices available within a given \"Security Level\" dialog will be fairly small.  \n\n\nIt is \nimportant\n to match the ISSEC clearance with the selected component.  The rule of thumb for this is to simply ensure that the slug you select in the \"Component\" field (i.e. ZICORE) matches the leading slug of the ISSEC level you select in the \"Security Level\" field.",

I would suggest creating a bookmark for the current URL to save yourselves time.\n\n\nOver the next few minutes, I will be sending you each invitation emails, which will contain all of the login information necessary for you to get started.  \n\n\nOutlook Signature\n\n\nINCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOTE:\nYOU MUST UPDATE YOUR OUTLOOK SIGNATURE TO INCLUDE 5 MINUS SIGNS/DASHES BEFORE THE SIGNATURE PRIOR TO USING JIRA.\n\n\nIf you do not do this, replying to a JIRA email to leave a comment or create an attachment to a task will copy the entire email chain into the comment and make a huge, huge mess.  \n\n\nThere is no other available workaround.\n\n\nIf you do make this change, you can reply to any JIRA email to leave a comment on a task, and any attachments to that email will be automatically uploaded to the task, which is really neat.  \n\n\nOutlook Labeling\n\n\nI would also HIGHLY recommend creating an Outlook filter to move all emails with [JIRA] in the subject line to a separate folder.  You will be receiving a lot of emails, as JIRA sends updates whenever something changes.  We will be tuning this moving forward, but at the beginning it will be a lot to keep up with if you have it coming directly into your inbox.\n\n\nStructural Notes\n\n\nThe general \u201cJIRA Metaphor\u201d for the SharePoint structure we have presently is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEpics roughly equate to SharePoint \u201cComponents\u201d\n\n\nStories roughly equate to SharePoint \u201cActivities\u201d\n\n\nSubtasks roughly equate to SharePoint \u201cTasks\u201d\n\n\n\n\nI have already taken the liberty of creating the following Epics for ZICORE:\n\n\n\n\nZICORE-1: Field Office Administration\n\n\nZICORE-14: Home Office Administration\n\n\nFIN-1: ZICORE Field Finance\n\n\nFIN-4: ZICORE Home Finance\n\n\nHR-7: ZICORE Field HR\n\n\nHR-12: ZICORE Home HR\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Usage Notes\n\n\nTo create a Story (think of it like a category of tasks with a common goal) within an Epic, click the + sign next to \u201cIssues in Epic,\u201d select \u201cStory\u201d under Issue Type, and fill in the requested information.  \n\n\nTo create a Subtask within a Story, click on the Story, then click \u201cMore \n Create Sub-Task,\u201d and fill in the requested information.\n\n\nDocuments can be attached to all issue types by simply dragging and dropping from your desktop.  Document categories can be assigned by dragging and dropping the document between categories on the issue screen.\n\n\nIssue Security levels can be adjusted for Epics and Stories within the HR and Finance projects (ZICORE would be the equivalent of \u201cZicore HR\u201d and ZICORE Restricted would be the equivalent of \u201cZicore HR-Restricted).  Subtasks inherit security levels from their parent.  \n\n\nTo tag a user in a comment or description, simply type the \u201c@\u201d sign followed by the user\u2019s name, i.e. @Pablo, and select the user from the box that appears.  \n\n\nIf you have finished the work that you need to do on a subtask, but further work is required from another user, change the \u201cAssignee\u201d field to reflect the person that needs to take the next steps.  Only one user can be assigned to an issue at any given time.\n\n\nOnce you have accepted the invitation to set up your JIRA account, please allow 10 minutes for your permissions to be set up.\n\n\nClosing Remarks\n\n\nPlease do not hesitate to \ncontact me\n with any questions, comments, or concerns.  This is a big transition, and there will undoubtedly be hiccups- it is my hope, however, that we can use this pilot project to polish the system before rolling out across the organization, and make sure that everyone has a great experience with it once it\u2019s live.\n\n\nPlease note that the information contained within these release notes may be duplicated elsewhere within the documentation, as it is currently a work in progress.",

If you do make this change, you can reply to any JIRA email to leave a comment on a task, and any attachments to that email will be automatically uploaded to the task, which is really neat.",

To create a Subtask within a Story, click on the Story, then click \u201cMore   Create Sub-Task,\u201d and fill in the requested information.  Documents can be attached to all issue types by simply dragging and dropping from your desktop.  Document categories can be assigned by dragging and dropping the document between categories on the issue screen.  Issue Security levels can be adjusted for Epics and Stories within the HR and Finance projects (ZICORE would be the equivalent of \u201cZicore HR\u201d and ZICORE Restricted would be the equivalent of \u201cZicore HR-Restricted).  Subtasks inherit security levels from their parent.    To tag a user in a comment or description, simply type the \u201c@\u201d sign followed by the user\u2019s name, i.e. @Pablo, and select the user from the box that appears.    If you have finished the work that you need to do on a subtask, but further work is required from another user, change the \u201cAssignee\u201d field to reflect the person that needs to take the next steps.  Only one user can be assigned to an issue at any given time.  Once you have accepted the invitation to set up your JIRA account, please allow 10 minutes for your permissions to be set up.",
